    <p>
        This group of merchants is forming an alliance to make more profit in the name of Waukeen.
        Their biggest project is the Global Convoy Project.
        This project consists of cutting transport costs/risks and evading taxes by teleporting past customs.
        The heresy lies in that this group took loans as if they already made the profit.
        Now the goods are stocked as long as the device is not ready.
        Trade in this stock is currently blooming, because they are profitable, but people are not aware that Yauhnn as a result is more and more living on the promise of goods,
        instead of real goods.
        The FTG is playing a pyramid game as long as the stored goods in Cormyr can't be delivered.
        And the bubble is about to burst.
    </p>

    <p>There are these reasons for the adventures to stop the FTG</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cormyr will miss millions of tax revenue, it will ruin Cormyrs social tax system</li>
        <li>The evil pollution will run unchecked if Hanuman can't perform his rituals. The evil will spread all over Faerun due to the teleport gates the installation creates</li>
        <li>After all debts have been paid, it will be easy to out compete any rivals on any market</li>
        <li>It will hit Olivet where it hurts</li>
        <li>Olivet will seize power and hold on to it to earn even more money</li>
        <li>Hoarding capital is bad, money should roll</li>
    </ul>
