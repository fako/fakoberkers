{% block events %}
    <p>
        As soon as the party gets the boat out of the jungle on the beach a Myrmarch teleports in with 4 workers.
        There are four scenarios:
    </p>
    <ol>
        Hosan is helping = Fihni teleports in from a distance. Accuses Hosan of treason. He proves he's not a traitor by attacking as well.
        Hosan is not helping = He teleports in saying he will have to prove to Fihni he was not helping you.
        Hosan is dead, party killed/stole = Fihni was searching for killers/thiefs and found them
        Hosan is dead, party didn't do anything = Fihni teleports in asking questions, leaves
    </ol>
