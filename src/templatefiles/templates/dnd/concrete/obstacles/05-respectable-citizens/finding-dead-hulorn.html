<p>Olivet will declare himself Hulorn by letting Lokahmee pose as Otalan</p>

<p>In the past 3 (lead by Olivet) out of 7 were FTG. With the hulorn switching sides this became 4 out of 7
This is of course not yet a 2/3 majority. However when the hulorn is found dead. Olivet will make Lokahmee pose as
Otalan and declare himself hulorn with 2/3 majority (FTG being 4 out of 6 at that time)</p>
