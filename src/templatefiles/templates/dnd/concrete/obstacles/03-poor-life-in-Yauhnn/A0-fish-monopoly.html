<p>The adventurers notice that they are tailed</p>

<p>It is thought that the guards are bribed (but they are just incompetent)</p>
<p>The only competitor left is someone who can do seasoning. This receipe is about to get nicked.</p>

<p>Hungry adventurers should be delighted with fish from Otalan :)</p>

Discovering Thekesh/Moltabar. What is the way in for these facts? Which leads are there besides Waukeen investigation? Are there prepurcosions to disabling fish market
* Wear the magic neckless of Thekesh
* Moltabar smells of fish

Smell of fish shoul be the smell of the slums. Thekesh gets incriminated by Waukeen and by Oracle as a traitor.

Waukeen mission

It has come to the attention of Waukeen priests in Ordulin that a monopoly is building in the fish trade in Yauhnn.
It is only natural that a good competitor at some point becomes the only competitor.
It this then important to open up the market and challenge merchants to do even better.
However a building monopoly has been denied by the local temple and this called for an investigation.
When asking around among the fishermen for prices and asking to see the books the inquisitor was faced with an attempt to take his life.
Now the local Waukeen temple is worried about the life of the inquisitor and hinders him in doing a real investigation.
The adventurers may be capable of unveiling facts that the inquisitor can't possibly get to any more.
Question is to visit Moltabar as an investor and see what his plans are, possibly viewing the books.
They could also pose as fishermen to see how Moltabar is able to keep prices so low.
Thekesh might be behind the smuggling, but when searching his appartment, nothing was found, not even anything of value.

Moltabar is not interested in investors, but adventurers do see a couple of clues that he's not who he pretends to be.
Similarly the adventurers could act as a union to negotiate better prices for the fishermen and see the same clues.
Adventurers can speak to Thekesh for getting a job. He asks them to speak to Moltabar for getting a better paid job (smuggle)
