<p>Aboleth quest (comes near to secret left and underdark shaft)</p>

<pre>
Nimry mission (people need to call them saviours wherever they go)

Nimry is an old lady that has seen to many of her loved ones disappear. She has grown bitter over this.
When the adventurers approach her for services she states that Talos is a worthless God.

"Well, well if it isn't our saviours. Don't think you get anything for free from me. What did Talos bring us ever,
but loss and pain? Why would it be different this time?"

If the adventurers are capable of assuring Nimry that they are different. Nimry will give it a shot.

"I used to protect these people. Whenever they got taken I would be the one to get them back in secret.
I couldn't save them all, but I did my best. Now I can't save any as these legs are abandoning me.
I'm not as good a swim as I used to be. How about it saviours? Are you truly willing to save these people
that live in the dirt, stink of fish and don't share your view on beauty?"

If they say yes Nimry continues.

"Sembia is formed by the rising of the underdark from the ocean. Its top is inhabited by the people of Sembia.
 Below the surface other creatures roam.
 Here in Yauhnn, as you can see, poor humans and the Locathah live in the shallows of the underdark depth.
 Further down more sinister monstroids stir in the dark. One of the foulest is the aberration called Zorbash.
It enslaves Locathah to live with him and do his hard work, until they collapse under the work load.
The so called merchant gentleman tolerate this slavery, because it serves them well to get rid of rebellious Locathah once in a while.
However this device will free the mind of any slave when you pronounce the command word and stay close.
I used to sneak in and out regularly to free the innocent. Not a day goes by without a longing to help,
but my body can't bear to do it any longer. Currently Helash son of Janolanash is in the grasp of Zorbash.
Try to get him out. I'll lend you the device if you swear to return it. If you manage to kill Zorbash you can keep it.
I have no need for it."

(Nimry is not interested in helping Mirika, because she is a half-elf)

When the adventurers do not take this quest on for some reason, then news of the death of Zorbash should persuade Nimry
 to give the artifact any way. She then states that: "there might be other uses for it".
