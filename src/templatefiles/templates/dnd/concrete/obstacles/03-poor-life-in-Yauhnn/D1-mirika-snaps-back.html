    Mirika awakes

When she snaps out of insanity Mirika has two questions.
1) Where am I?
2) Where is my father?
Then she tells about her last memory. How her father went missing and that she found him being in love with a woman she did not know.
When I went to see him to ask how he was and why he did not respond to messages he couldn't remember the messages
He also hadn't done any work. Instead he was busy with a wedding present for this woman who was going to be his wife.
When after days of talking I persuaded him to take a break and come back home ... there is nothing but a blur. It was awful.


What will she be doing? I suppose waiting around. Begging for them to leave the device with her. Offers her help, but needs to get charged.
Discovers something fun about slums (like the children?)
How do the adventurers make the connection that Mirika needs to talk to her father to break his love?
How did Mirika get close to her father to begin with?
Mirika stats!
