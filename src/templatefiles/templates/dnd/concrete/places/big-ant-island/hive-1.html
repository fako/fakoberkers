{% block summary %}
    <p>
        Level with mostly living quarters for Formians.
        Safest to enter and look at vessel from above.
    </p>
{% endblock %}

{% block events %}
    <p>During the day all Formians are asleep. Except 2 patrols with 2 Myrmians</p>
    <p>In the evening and night the Hive is at its busiest. Workers do not act as guards</p>
{% endblock %}

{% block locations %}
    <p>
        The hive is the home of the Formians.
        It is made out of dirt providing smooth walls (ClimbDC 20)
        They store mostly food (especially sweet food), but also other things that they find and can get their hands on.
    </p>
    <p>
        All area's on this level are sleeping quarters for warriors and workers (they mix).
        Taskmasters sleep with the monsters on level 0 and Myrmarchs also sleep on level 0.
        During the night this level is abandoned except for a few workers that can't sound the alarm really.
        Chamber 8 is the same chamber as on level 0, but 15ft higher.
