    <ul>
        <li>
            Up the <a href=headland.html"">headland</a> to your left.
            This seems a very though climb (ClimbDC25) due to steepness (+5) and the thick growth (+5).
            You can also go <a href="headland.html">around the headland</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            A small stream in front of the headland is going into the sea.
            Follow that stream into <a href="abandoned-village.html">milder wilderness</a>
        </li>
        <li>To the <a href="beach-center.html">beach</a> on your right</li>
        <li><a href="abandoned-village.html">Inland</a> (towards village if SpotDC15)</li>
        <li>The wild <a href="sea.html">sea</a> lies behind you</li>
