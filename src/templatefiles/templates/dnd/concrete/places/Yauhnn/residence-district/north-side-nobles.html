    <p><b>
        The residents in this area are clearly wealthy. Among many big houses you also see buildings that appear to be used as offices.
        The buildings often hold marble signs that indicate which business is situated inside.
        On a square there is a bronze statue of a donkey. It barks and has its tail upright and beneath its ass stands a bag with coins.
        The inscription reads: "the golden age is coming"
    </b></p>

    <p>
        In front of one building that reads <a href="../../../groups/Faerun-trade-group.html">Faerun Trade Group</a> a man is talking to a closed door.
        He says that he wants to cancel his investment and that he needs his money now. He seems quite desparate, but the door remains shut.
    </p>

    <h4>Stealing</h4>
    <p>
        It is feasible to make a profit out of robbing some of the nobles here.
        In one night a rogue can make 1d20 * 300 in an evening in this area.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stealing is never without risks and every night there is probably an incident where the rogue almost gets caught.
        After stealing 10.000 euro in the city there starts to a lot more awareness.
        Per 10.000 gp there is a +10% change that a night goes horribly wrong and the rogue gets caught successfully.
