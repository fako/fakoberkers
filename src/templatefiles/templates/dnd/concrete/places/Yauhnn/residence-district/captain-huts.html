    <p><b>
        All houses in Yauhnn are relatively simple. The Sembians believe more in trade than in bricks.
        However there are big differences between houses and the houses in this neighborhood clearly belong to the rich.
        Their walled gardens and balconies face the sun. The houses are larger than any other in the city
        and although the bricks are not ornamented, inside a lot art and other valuables are plain in sight.
        The name for this area is clearly a nickname for the residencies of Yauhnn's most prominent.
    </b></p>
    <p>It is hard to distinguish one house from another and locations below can't be reached unless they know they want to go there.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>House of <a href="../../../characters/Taduan+hulorn-animal-merchant.html">Taduan (hulorn)</a></li>
        <li>House of <a href="../../../characters/Dragbar+metal-merchant.html">Dragbar</a></li>
        <li>House of <a href="../../../characters/Otalan+food-and-drink-merchant.html">Otalan</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>From here adventurers can go to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Down any ramp to <a href="../trade-district/the-goods.html">The goods</a></li>
        <li>South towards <a href="north-side-nobles.html">North side nobles</a></li>
        <li>To the far end of the city towards <a href="northern-tower.html">The Northern Tower</a> (that holds the library)</li>

    <p>
        It is feasible to make a profit out of robbing some of the nobles here.
        In one night a rogue can make 1d20 * 400 in an evening in this area.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stealing is never without risks and every night there is probably an incident where the rogue almost gets caught.
        After stealing 10.000 euro in the city there starts to a lot more awareness.
        Per 10.000 gp there is a +10% change that a night goes horribly wrong and the rogue gets caught successfully.
