        <dd>
            10 >= Goddess of trade and the marketplace.
            She loves money for all the things that you can do with it.
            A society blooms if it has a lot of money and her followers try to make as much of it as possible.

        <dd>
            13 >= Goddess creates money with a Holy donkey that shits gold when you pull his tail.
            This money will allow everybody to become rich and enjoy life.

            15 >= Recently got back from being held prisoner in mortal form by Graz'zt.
            Another enemy in the pantheon is Mask.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            20 >= A controversial aspect of Waukeen is that she creates money out of nothing for the sake of abundance.
            Giving people without capital a loan will give them a better life and stimulate the community.
            Another thing that raises eye brows left and right is that she facilitates illegal trade as much as legal trade.
