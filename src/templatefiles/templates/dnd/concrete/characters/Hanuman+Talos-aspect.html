        Hanuman is always at strain with Talos. He is truly good and thinks that not all means justify the cause.
        He rebels against his father, who in turn, doesn't allow him to perform miracle (or any 9th level spell).
        Hanuman's soul gives him powers to destroy as well as his ability to change shape.
        From his "devotee cleric" class he only gets defensive spells
