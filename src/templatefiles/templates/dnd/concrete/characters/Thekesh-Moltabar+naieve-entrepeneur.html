{% block summary %}A business man from the slums. Involved in "fish scam". Works for FTG{% endblock %}

{% block story %}
    <p>
        Thekesh (his real name) is a self made man. He climbed the social ladder through entrepreneurship.
        This did not go unnoticed by FTG.
        They offered him a business outside of the slums if he would arrange an alternative route to Waukeen scales.
        With a magic item he wears around his neck he turns into Moltabar.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fish scam works as follows.
        Fish got sold for a long time below market prices.
        This price war supported by FTG made Moltabar the only fish merchant.
        Moltabar could then press the Locathah to sell at lower prices, forcing them to search different work.
        This work involved smuggling things past the Waukeen scales for FTG.
        Their #1 need is mithral, which Locathah children put inside dead fishes, making wounds on their hands infect.
        The dead fishes are brought to the underdark
        and float to the surface into the FTG lab through a natural shaft.
