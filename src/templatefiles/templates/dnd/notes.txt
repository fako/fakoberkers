The Faerun Trade Group scheme

Cormyr especially tries to keep the tax burden for its citizens low
It does so by taxing international trade
This infuriates Sembians, as well as the Waukeen temple

A select group of merchant in the council calling themselves the Faerun Trade Group are planning to build a Golem which can teleport objects of any size anywhere
Their plan is to take on trade everywhere in Fearun and out do competitors
Their first objective is to bypass Cormyr taxation, by teleporting from inside Cormyr
They have assumed they would succeed and are hording their riches for quite some time.
Yauhnn as a result is more and more living on the promise of goods, instead of real goods.

The Faerun Trade Group is paying with loans. Receivers of these loans will get interest as well as the loaned money
Everybody who can will want to have FTG loans, because they are always good for their interest.
The FTG is playing a pyramid game as long as the stored goods in Cormyr can't be delivered.
The FTG is expecting to make profits, because they dodge the tax system and cut out transport costs
They are however not taking into account what the external costs of running the installation will be

There are these reasons for the adventures to stop the FTG
1)   Cormyr will miss millions of tax revenue, it will ruin Cormyrs social tax system
2)   The evil pollution will run unchecked if Hanuman can't perform his rituals. The evil will spread all over Faerun due to the teleport gates the installation creates
3)   After all debts have been paid, it will be easy to out compete any rivals on any market
4)   It will hit Olivet where it hurts
5)   Olivet will seize power and hold on to it to earn even more money
6)   Hoarding capital is bad, money should roll
