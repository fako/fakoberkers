The Thekesh/Moltabar scheme

The fish are smuggled past Waukeen scale, through the cave complex, to the fish market
At the same time he smuggles Mithral which gets sold
Fish is sold at a low price
Fish is bought for a low price, making it tough for fishermen to get around
Because it is hard to get around the slum inhabitants do some illegal work on the side
It is thought that the guards are bribed (but they are just incompetent)
There is no toezicht on sold quantities to allow for import other than the harbor
The only competitor left is someone who can do seasoning. This receipe is about to get nicked.
Children need to open fish, put mithral in and when they cut themselves on the metal, the wounds fester

When the guy gets caught:
 - It becomes clear he earns most of his money with smuggling Mithral
 - The hulorn bails him out



Smuggle route for fish/Mithral:
    * a subterranean river that leads to the natural shaft, that goes up the lab
    * dead fish with mithral float up to the lab
    * a long the route they meet Aboleth (hook to null psionics item)



The Fearun Trade Group scheme

Cormyr especially tries to keep the tax burden for its citizens low
It does so by taxing international trade
This infuriates Sembians, as well as the Waukeen church

A select group of merchant in the council calling themselves the Faerun Trade Group are planning to build an installation which can teleport objects of any size anywhere
Their plan is to take on trade everywhere in Fearun and out do competitors
Their first objective is to bypass Cormyr taxation, by teleporting from inside Cormyr
They have assumed they would succeed and are hording their riches for quite some time.
Yauhnn as a result is more and more living on the promise of goods, instead of real goods.

The Faerun Trade Group is paying with loans. Receivers of these loans will get interest as well as the loaned money
Everybody who can will want to have FTG loans, because they are always good for their interest.
The FTG is playing a pyramid game as long as the stored goods in Cormyr can't be delivered.
The FTG is expecting to make profits, because they dodge the tax system and cut out transport costs
They are however not taking into account what the external costs of running the installation will be

There are these reasons for the adventures to stop the FTG
1)   Cormyr will miss millions of tax revenue, it will ruin Cormyrs social tax system
2)   The evil pollution will run unchecked if Hanuman can't perform his rituals. The evil will spread all over Faerun due to the teleport gates the installation creates
3)   After all debts have been paid, it will be easy to out compete any rivals on any market
4)   It will hit Olivet where it hurts
5)   Olivet will seize power and hold on to it to earn even more money
6)   Hoarding capital is bad, money should roll



Yauhnn politics

There are seven merchants sitting in the council that is controlling the city of which the hulorn is president.
For many small matters the hulorn has obsolute power
For bigger decisions the hulorn has to have a majority in his council
For very big decisions there has to be a 2/3 majority in the council

In the past 3 (lead by Olivet) out of 7 were FTG. With the hulorn switching sides this became 4 out of 7
This is of course not yet a 2/3 majority. However when the hulorn is found dead. Olivet will make Lokahmee pose as
fish merchant and declare himself hulorn with 2/3 majority (FTG being 4 out of 6 at that time)



Construct puzzles

* A huge construct that patrols a chasm. (the natural shaft!)
  It stays upright by holding on to the chasm
  destroy the chasm and you'll destroy the construct

* Acidic lake or another hostile environment

* A nice rebus: True seeing + comprh lang OR read magic onthult boven grote platte steen: (ruit)R+SL 	(diamond)[0]+E XR=L (illusionist herkent als illusory script)
