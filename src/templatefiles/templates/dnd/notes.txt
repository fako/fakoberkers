The Thekesh/Moltabar scheme

The fish are smuggled past Waukeen Waag, through the cave complex, to the fish market
Fish is sold at a low price
Fish is bought for a low price, making it tough for fishermen to get around
Because it is hard to get around the slum inhabitants do some illegal work on the side
It is thought that the guards are bribed (but they are just incompetent)
There is no toezicht on sold quantities to allow for import other than the harbor
The only competitor left is someone who can do seasoning. This receipe is about to get nicked.
Children are used to crawl through the small smuggle route
